	and then through the wreck, a handshake fled my name across the side of the highway, spilling out like guts. that was when i knew that she was the one.
	do you still see her face now, looking down on you in that wispy visage? is she idea or human? which do you prefer?
	i was awake once, in that vast hallway in the spaces between memory;
	that fleeting timeless fantasy where my ashes spread against star dust and beamed energy into that rotting corpse you string around and pretend is still alive.
	in every movement encoding a hypothetical culture in the hopes of synchronizing with that universal hallucination called meaning.
	is she dead, now that i've said her aloud enough times to invoke her image? does she burrow like she does in mine?
	i couldn't get out, even if i tried. all words exited in a double bind.
